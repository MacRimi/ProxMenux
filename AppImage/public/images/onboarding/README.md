# Onboarding Images

Place your screenshot images here with the following names:

- `imagen1.png` - Overview section screenshot
- `imagen2.png` - Storage section screenshot
- `imagen3.png` - Network section screenshot
- `imagen4.png` - VMs & LXCs section screenshot
- `imagen5.png` - Hardware section screenshot
- `imagen6.png` - System Logs section screenshot

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Recommended size**: 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio
- **Quality**: High quality screenshots showing the main features of each section
- **Content**: Capture the full section with representative data

## Notes

- The last slide (Future Updates) doesn't need an image as it uses an icon
- If an image fails to load, the component will show a fallback icon
- Images should be optimized for web (compressed but still high quality)
